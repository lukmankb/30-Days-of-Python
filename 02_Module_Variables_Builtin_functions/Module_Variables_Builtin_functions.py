first_name = 'Lukman'
last_name = "Kabiru"
fullName ='Lukman Kabiru Bala'
country = "Nigeria"
city = 'Kebbi'
age = 21
current_year = 2024
is_married = False
is_true = True
is_light_on = True
first_name, last_name, age, is_married = 'Lukman', 'Kabiru', 21, True 


Check the data type of all your variables using type() built-in function
print(type(first_name))
print(type(last_name))
print(type(fullName))
print(type(country))
print(type(city))
print(type(age))
print(type(current_year))
print(type(is_married))
print(type(is_true))
print(type(is_light_on))
Using the len() built-in function, find the length of your first name
print(len(first_name))
Compare the length of your first name and your last name
Declare 5 as num_one and 4 as num_two
num_one, num_two = 5, 4
Add num_one and num_two and assign the value to a variable total
total = num_one + num_two
Subtract num_two from num_one and assign the value to a variable diff
diff = num_one - num_two
Multiply num_two and num_one and assign the value to a variable product
product = num_one * num_two
Divide num_one by num_two and assign the value to a variable division
division = num_one / num_two
Use modulus division to find num_two divided by num_one and assign the value to a variable remainder
remainder = num_two % num_one
Calculate num_one to the power of num_two and assign the value to a variable exp
exp = num_one ** num_two
Find floor division of num_one by num_two and assign the value to a variable floor_division
floor_division = num_one // num_two
The radius of a circle is 30 meters.
radius = 30, pi = 3.142
Calculate the area of a circle and assign the value to a variable name of area_of_circle
area_of_circle = pi * (radius ** 2)
Calculate the circumference of a circle and assign the value to a variable name of circum_of_circle
circum_of_Circe = 2 * pi * radius
Take radius as user input and calculate the area.
radius_input = input('Input Radius: ')
area = pi * (radius_input ** 2)
print(f'Area of Circle = {area}')
Use the built-in input function to get first name, last name, country and age from a user and store the value to their corresponding variable names
Run help('keywords') in Python shell or in your file to check for the Python reserved words or keywords
